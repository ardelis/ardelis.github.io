			Security Capabilities and Policy for Transmission of Payment Card Details
		</h1>

		<h2>Commitment to Security:</h2>
		<p>
			At Ardelis Technologies, we take the security of your personal and payment
			information seriously. Our commitment to data security is designed to
			ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your
			information throughout the transaction process.
		</p>
		<h2>Secure Payment Processing with Stripe:</h2>
		<p>
			We have partnered with Stripe, a global leader in online payment
			processing, to securely handle your payment card details. Stripe is
			certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1, the most stringent level of
			certification available in the payments industry. This means that your
			payment information is protected by the highest standards of security.
		</p>
		<h2>Encryption and Data Protection:</h2>
		<h3>Encryption in Transit:</h3>
		<p>
			All information transmitted between your device and our servers, including
			payment card details, is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer
			(SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. This ensures that your
			data is secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties during
			transmission.
		</p>
		<h3>Encryption at Rest:</h3>
		<p>
			Stripe also encrypts your payment information when it is stored on their
			servers, providing an additional layer of security for your sensitive
			data.
		</p>
		<h2>No Storage of Payment Card Details:</h2>
		<p>
			Ardelis Technologies does not store your credit or debit card details on
			our servers. Once you enter your payment information, it is directly
			transmitted to Stripe for processing. This approach minimizes the risk of
			your payment details being exposed from our system.
		</p>
		<h2>Compliance and Audits:</h2>
		<p>
			Our website and Stripe regularly undergo security audits and compliance
			checks to ensure adherence to industry best practices and regulatory
			requirements. These efforts help to maintain a secure environment for
			processing your transactions.
		</p>
		<h2>Monitoring and Prevention:</h2>
		<p>
			We continuously monitor our systems for potential vulnerabilities and
			attacks. In partnership with Stripe, we implement measures to prevent
			unauthorized access and protect against security threats.
		</p>
		<h2>Customer Responsibility:</h2>
		<p>
			While we take every measure to ensure the security of your transaction,
			it's also important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
			password and to your computer. Ensure that you sign off when finished
			using a shared computer and never share your personal account details with
			others.
		</p>
		<h2>Contact Us:</h2>
		<p>
			If you have any questions or concerns about our security practices or if
			you suspect any issues with a transaction, please contact us immediately
			at <a href="mailto:admin@ardelistech.com">admin@ardelistech.com</a>. Your
			security and trust are our top priorities.
