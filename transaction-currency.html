		<h1>Transaction Currency</h1>

		<h3>Currency of Transactions:</h3>
		<p>
			All transactions processed on
			<a href="www.ardelistech.com">www.ardelistech.com</a> and
			<a href="www.iriss.ai">www.iriss.ai</a> are conducted in Euro (€). The use
			of Euro as our standard transaction currency simplifies the payment
			process for our customers located in the Eurozone and other parts of the
			world familiar with this currency.
		</p>
		<h3>Payment Processing:</h3>
		<p>
			We have partnered with Stripe, a leading online payment processing
			platform, to securely handle all financial transactions. Stripe supports a
			wide range of payment methods, ensuring a seamless checkout experience for
			our customers.
		</p>
		<h3>Currency Conversion:</h3>
		<p>
			Customers making purchases from outside the Eurozone may be subject to
			currency conversion fees applied by their card issuer or bank. The final
			amount charged by your bank or card issuer may vary due to these
			conversion rates, and Ardelis Technologies has no control over these rates
			or fees. We recommend consulting with your bank or card issuer if you have
			any questions regarding currency conversion or associated fees.
		</p>
		<h3>Price Display:</h3>
		<p>
			All prices on our website are displayed in Euro (€). For your convenience,
			you may use our currency converter tool (if available) to estimate the
			cost in your local currency. Please note, this is an estimate only, and
			the actual charge will be in Euro (€).
		</p>
		<h3>Secure Transactions:</h3>
		<p>
			Security is paramount at Ardelis Technologies . Stripe's advanced security
			measures ensure that your payment information is encrypted and securely
			processed without any compromise to your data privacy.
